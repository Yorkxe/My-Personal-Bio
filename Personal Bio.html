          <p class="introduction">
            Hello! I'm York, now a technical engineer with a passion
            for computer-science.Now I'm learning front-end and Java now.
            And I had several Python projects in Github.
            Below I'll show some of them and illustrate the functions.
            If you wnat to know more info,

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/Yorkxe/Monte-Carlo-Simulation">Monte-Carlo-Simulation</a></h3>
          <p class="projects">A program shows that sometimes it is a random event at the first sight but when it comes to a very large amount the result will convert to a constant number. Imagine a 100 x 50 of rectangle area, and there're two small area. One shape is circle, its centre is at (20, 20) and the radius is 10. One shape is aquare, its centre is at (80, 10) and each of its side length is also 10.</p>
          <img src="Monte-Carlo-Simulation Area.PNG" class="projects-img">
          <p class="projects">And we started to throw marbles from a random location above the area. So what's the ratio of marble in circle area and marble in square area? It seems that it could be 0 ~ 1, right? But how about we throwed 100 marbles, 1000 marbles, 10000 marbles?The results is quite interesting, click the link above and check it out.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/Yorkxe/Stock-Reminder">Stock Reminder</a></h3>
          <p class="projects">A program provides the history data of a specific stock serial. And it automatically creates a candle figure to show the trend. It uses Selenium and tkinter, the former is to get the history data from TWSE(Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation) website and the latter is the UI to enter the Year、Month、Serial number you want. The TWSE website itself and there are two comboboxes to select the year and month and one enter column to type the stock serial you want.</p>

          <p>Below is the candle figure made by the program.</p>
